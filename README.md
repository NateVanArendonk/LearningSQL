# PostgreSQL CSV Loader with Ruby

Welcome to the **PostgreSQL CSV Loader with Ruby** repository! ðŸš€

## What is this?

This repository contains Ruby scripts for efficiently loading CSV files into PostgreSQL databases. If you're dealing with large datasets or frequently importing CSV files into your PostgreSQL database, these scripts will streamline the process and save you valuable time.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to provide a set of Ruby scripts that automate the process of loading CSV files into PostgreSQL tables. I primarily used this tool for loading in ensemble stream forecasts in WA state and performed statistical analysis on the loaded data to evaluate changes in the riverine climate.
